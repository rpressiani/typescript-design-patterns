## Singleton

**Singleton** is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides single point of access to it for any other code.

Logging can be an example of where the Singleton pattern could be used. Most of the classes in a project could use a logger and we don't want to instantiate a new object for every class, but rather always use the same one.
